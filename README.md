### 🔒 AccessModifier.cs
Worked on **C# access modifiers** demonstrating different levels of accessibility in classes and inheritance.

#### 🔹 Access Modifiers Covered
- **public**: Accessible from anywhere
- **private**: Accessible only within the same class
- **protected**: Accessible within the same class and derived classes
- **internal**: Accessible within the same assembly
- **protected internal**: Accessible within the same assembly or derived classes
- **private protected**: Accessible within the same class or derived classes in the same assembly

#### 🔹 Code Demonstration
- Created `PublicClass` with public members accessible from Main
- Created `InternalClass` with internal members accessible within the same assembly
- Created `BaseClass` with members using all access modifier types
- Created `DerivedClass` inheriting from `BaseClass` to demonstrate inheritance access rules
- In Main method, instantiated classes and accessed members based on their access levels

#### 🔹 Key Points on Access Modifiers
- **public**: No restrictions on access; can be accessed from any code
- **private**: Highest level of restriction; only accessible within the declaring class
- **protected**: Accessible within the declaring class and any derived classes
- **internal**: Accessible within the same assembly but not from other assemblies
- **protected internal**: Accessible within the same assembly or from derived classes in other assemblies
- **private protected**: Accessible within the declaring class or derived classes, but only within the same assembly
- Access modifiers are crucial for encapsulation and controlling the visibility of class members
- Inheritance expands accessibility for protected and related modifiers to derived classes
