### 📘 C# Fundamentals Practice

---

### 📋 DataTypes.cs
Worked on **C# data types** and **type casting concepts** with clear examples.

#### 🔹 Data Types Covered
- **int** – Integer values (e.g., `5`)
- **double** – High-precision floating-point values (e.g., `5.0`)
- **float** – Floating-point values (e.g., `3.5f`)
- **char** – Single character values (e.g., `'A'`)
- **string** – Sequence of characters (e.g., `"Hello World"`)
- **bool** – Boolean values (`true` / `false`)

#### 🔹 Type Casting
- **Implicit Casting**
  - `int → float`
  - `int → double`
  - `char → int`
  - `char → double`
  - `char → float`

- **Explicit Casting**
  - `int → char`
  - `double → int`
  - `double → float`
  - `double → char`
  - `float → int`
  - `float → double`
  - `float → char`

- **Conversion to String**
  - Used `ToString()` with `int`, `double`, `float`, and `char`

### 🔢 Operations.cs
Practiced **operators in C#** with real examples.

#### 🔹 Operators Covered
- **Arithmetic Operators**  
  `+` `-` `*` `/` `%`

- **Relational Operators**  
  `==` `!=` `>` `<` `>=` `<=`

- **Logical Operators**  
  `&&` `||` `!`

- **Assignment Operators**  
  `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=`

- **Unary Operators**  
  `++` `--` (pre and post increment/decrement)

- **Ternary Operator**  
  `?:` – Used for conditional logic (e.g., finding maximum value)

- **`is` Operator**  
  - Used for type checking in inheritance scenarios
